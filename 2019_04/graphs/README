About the graphs
-----------------------------------

Each test's results are displayed in two separate graphs.
And please note that the scales on the Y-axes of the two graphs
are always different. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to see
any interesting structure in either.

The first graph displays all data up to "2 Nines". The second
graph displays all data from 2 Nines to Max.

What does that mean?

As each message arrives at the receiver, its total flight time 
is measured by the receiver. All these flight-time numbers are
first gathered into a list and then "binned". The continuous 
latency numberline is divided into discrete chunks -- "bins" -- 
of 10 microseconds each, and we count how many messages fell 
into each of those bins. That gives us a list of integer counts, 
and it is this list of integers which is graphed.  The purple 
curve you see in the images is the resulting histogram.

There are also vertical red lines on the graph, with labels like
"1 Nine", "2 Nine", etc.  Those lines show what percentage of all
images are to the left of them in the graph, i.e. at that latency
or faster. For example, if the "3 Nine" line is at 0.7 msec, it 
means that 0.999 of all messages had latencies of 0.7 msec or faster.
By comparing the values of these lines between tests you can see
changes that would otherwise be much too subtle to detect visually.


Each directory contains the results from a separate series of tests,
with { 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 170, 200 } receivers, and also contains
a summary image combining all of those at once. The individual 
results images were made with the data processing software stored in 
this project, but the summary image combining them all was made by hand.
