The data directories that belong here are instead stored at:

   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n9U8iQhgBDTP7nGbv4XFMbNAB4jltSdl?usp=sharing

That link should be readbale by all Red Hat.
It points to the equivalent of this directory : 

     dispatch_latency/2019_04/data 

But then what outght to ge the subdirectories { 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 170, 200 }
are instead storead as  tar.gz  files.


Sorry, I could not upload so much data here.
